        </p>

        <p>
          When you access the Website, the Company will learn certain information about you during your visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Information You Provide To Us.</strong> The Website provides various places for users to provide information. We collect information that users 
          provide by filling out forms on the Website, communicating with us via contact forms, responding to surveys, search queries on our 
          search feature, providing comments or other feedback, and providing information when ordering a product or service via the Website.

        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technology.</strong> As you navigate through our Website, we may use automatic data 
          collection technologies including Google Analytics to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. This will generally

          things, we will collect data about the type of computer you use, your Internet connection, your IP address, your operating system, and your browser type.

      <p>
        <strong>USE OF COOKIES AND PIXELS</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Like other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and server logs to collect information about how our site is used. 
          Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites 
          visited just before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.
       </p>

        <p>
          A cookie is a small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site’s computer asks your computer 
          for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser 
          if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, 
          not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
        </p>

       <p>
        The Company reserves the right to use technological equivalents of cookies, including social media pixels. These pixels allow social media sites to track 
        visitors to outside websites to tailor advertising messages users see while visiting that social media website. The Company reserves the right to use these 
        pixels in compliance with the policies of the various social media sites. 
       </p>

     <p>
      <strong>THIRD PARTY USE OF COOKIES</strong>
     </p>

     <p>
      Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content 
      providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to 
      collect information about you when you use our website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect 
      information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may 
      use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
     </p>

     <p>
      We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted 
      content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.
     </p>

     <p>
      <strong>EMAIL INFORMATION</strong>
     </p>

     <p>
      If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. 
      We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received online, mail, and 
      telephone. This also applies when you register for our website, sign up through any of our forms using your email address or make a purchase on this 
      site. For further information see the email policies below.

    offers for products and services, providing you with information about your subscriptions and products, carrying out any contract between you and 
    the Company, administering our business activities, providing customer service, and making available other items and services to our customers 
    and prospective customers.
   </p>
  
   <p>
    From time-to-time, we may use the information you provide to us to display advertisements to you that are tailored to your personal characteristics, 
    interests, and activities.
   </p>
         
    <p>
      <strong>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
    </p>    

    <p>
      Generally, we do not sell, rent, lease or otherwise transfer any information collected whether automatically or through your voluntary action.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries, affiliates, and service providers for the purpose of providing our services to you.
    </p>
         
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to a third party, including a lawyer or collection agency, when necessary to enforce our terms of service or 
      any other agreement between you and the Company.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may provide your information to any successor in interest in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or 
      other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company’s asserts and/or business.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the 
      protection of our legal rights or when compelled by a court or other governmental entity to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION AND SECURE INFORMATION TRANSMISSIONS?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      We employ commercially reasonable methods to ensure the security of the information you provide to us and the information we collect automatically. 
      This includes using standard security protocols and working only with reputable third-party vendors.  Email is not recognized as a secure medium of 
      communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. However, doing so is allowed, but at your own risk. 
      Some of the information you may enter on our website may be transmitted securely via a secure medium known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL. Credit Card 
      information and other sensitive information is never transmitted via email.
    </p>
         
    <p>
     The Company may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different 
     sections of our site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or 
     problem areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Company uses software programs to monitor network traffic 
      to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
    </p>
       
    <p>
      <strong>POLICY CHANGES</strong>
    </p>
         
    <p>
      It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal 
      information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account and/or through a notice on the Website home page. The date 
      the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the bottom of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable 
      email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes.

    </p>

    <p>
      You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority that has jurisdiction over issues related to the General Data Protection Regulation.
    </p>
